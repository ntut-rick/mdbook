optical, electromagnetic frequencies divided into (narrow) frequency bands = each call allocated its own band, can transmit at max rate of that narrow band 
### Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)

time divided into slots = each call allocated periodic slot(s), can transmit at maximum rate of (wider) frequency band, but only during its time slot(s)
